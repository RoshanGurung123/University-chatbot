# University-chatbot
In this project, I have created a university chatbot using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques. I have used the Seq2Seq model which is a neural network-based model that takes a sequence of words as input and generates a sequence of words as output. To implement this I have used the Tensorflow library.

About the dataset used:
I have used the dataset which is available on Kaggle it consists of a JSON file that contains information related to the university inquiries.
